             This project was made in Abobe illustrtor and edited in Photoshop. At first I was having trouble with my creative process on what I wanted to do for this project. But rather of having nothing to do for the project 
             I had loads of ideas but didnet know which one to do, sometimes it can be hard to be creative because your afraid of what you put out there is not good enough. My teacher (that's you Jesse) helped me with the concept
             of what you see now. We both agreed to make an illustration of my head bursting with creativity. All the things you see coming out of my head are my own creations and characters, I had alot of fun making this in illusrator
             and I plan to make this my mascot.
